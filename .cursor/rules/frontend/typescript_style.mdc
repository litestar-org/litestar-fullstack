# TypeScript Style and Conventions

## Objective
To ensure consistent, type-safe, and maintainable TypeScript code.

## Context
- TypeScript used for frontend development (React/ShadCN/Vite).
- Configuration in `src/js/tsconfig.json`.
- Linting via Biome (from `biome.json`).

## Rules

### Typing
- Strive for strong typing. Avoid `any` where possible. Use `unknown` for safer alternatives to `any`.
- Use specific types (interfaces, type aliases) for objects, props, and state.

### Style
- Follow Biome formatter and linter rules.
- Use `PascalCase` for types, interfaces, and enums.
- Use `camelCase` for functions and variables.

### Modules
- Use ES Modules (`import`/`export`).

## Exceptions
- Interfacing with JavaScript libraries that lack types might require some `any` or type assertions.
