# CI/CD Pipeline Conventions (GitHub Actions)

## Objective
To maintain robust, efficient, and understandable CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, building, and deployment.

## Context
- GitHub Actions used for CI/CD (workflows in `.github/workflows/`).

## Rules

### Workflow Structure
- **Clarity**: Define clear job and step names.
- **Triggers**: Configure appropriate triggers (push, pull_request, schedule, manual).
- **Caching**: Utilize caching for dependencies (pip, npm) to speed up builds.

### Testing & Linting
- Run linters, type checkers, and tests (unit, integration) on every relevant trigger (e.g., PRs to main).
- Ensure test reports and coverage are generated and accessible.

### Building & Deployment
- Build Docker images in CI.
- Implement secure deployment strategies (e.g., to staging/production environments).
- Use GitHub Actions secrets for sensitive data (API keys, tokens).

### Reusability
- Use reusable workflows or composite actions for common tasks if pipelines become complex.

## Exceptions
- Simple, non-critical workflows might have a more basic structure.
