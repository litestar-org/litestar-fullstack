# Static Analysis Tooling

## Objective
To maintain high code quality and catch errors early by adhering to configurations of static analysis tools.

## Context
- Python: Ruff (linting, formatting, import sorting), MyPy & Pyright (type checking), Slotscheck.
- Frontend: Biome (linting, formatting for JS/TS).
- Tools configured in `pyproject.toml` and `biome.json`.
- Enforced via pre-commit hooks.

## Rules

### Adherence
- Code MUST pass all configured static analysis checks.
- Resolve or appropriately ignore (with justification) reported errors/warnings.

### Configuration
- Tool configurations (`pyproject.toml`, `biome.json`) should be version-controlled and consistently applied.
- Regularly review and update tool configurations and versions.

### Pre-commit Hooks
- Ensure pre-commit hooks for these tools are active and maintained.

## Exceptions
- Specific lines may be ignored with `# type: ignore`, `eslint-disable-next-line`, etc., but must include a comment explaining why.
